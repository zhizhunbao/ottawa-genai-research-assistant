## Reading Strategy

### First Pass (5-10 minutes)

1. Read title, abstract, conclusions
2. Look at figures and captions
3. Skim introduction and section headings
4. Decide if worth deeper read

### Second Pass (1 hour)

1. Read carefully but skip proofs
2. Note key points and techniques
3. Mark unclear parts
4. Understand main contributions

### Third Pass (4-5 hours)

1. Virtually re-implement the paper
2. Understand every assumption
3. Challenge every statement
4. Think about improvements
