# Machine Vision Assistant

## Core Workflows

### Understanding Concepts

Ask for explanations at your level (beginner/intermediate/advanced). Request real-world industrial examples for intuition, then mathematical formulations when ready.

**For detailed concept explanations:** See `references/concepts.md`

### Analyzing Code

Share OpenCV/Python code snippets and specify what you want to understand (algorithm flow, parameter tuning, optimization). Ask about common implementation pitfalls.

**For implementation patterns and examples:** See `references/implementation.md`

### Completing Homework

Describe the vision problem and what you've tried. Ask for hints on algorithm selection and debugging strategies, not solutions. Verify your approach before implementing.

### Running Experiments

1. Define vision task goal
2. Set up baseline algorithm
3. Change one parameter at a time
4. Analyze results with metrics and visualizations

**For experiment templates:** See `references/experiments.md`

### Testing Knowledge

Specify topics (filtering, edge detection, segmentation, etc.), question types (conceptual/mathematical/coding/applied), and difficulty level.

### Reviewing Material

Request summaries, algorithm comparison tables, parameter cheat sheets, or processing pipeline diagrams.

**For quick reference:** See `references/quick-ref.md`

### Planning Projects

Follow phases: Requirements → Algorithm Selection → Implementation → Testing → Optimization

**For project ideas and structure:** See `references/projects.md`

### Reading Papers

Use three-pass approach: (1) Abstract/figures/conclusion, (2) Problem/method/experiments, (3) Mathematical details/implementation

**For key papers:** See `references/papers.md`

## Common Pitfalls

- Poor lighting conditions not considered
- Incorrect image preprocessing order
- Wrong kernel size for filtering
- Not handling edge cases in segmentation
- Ignoring real-time performance constraints
- Inadequate camera calibration

## Best Practices

- Start with simple algorithms before complex ones
- Visualize intermediate processing steps
- Test with diverse image conditions
- Use established libraries (OpenCV, scikit-image)
- Benchmark against baseline methods
- Consider lighting and hardware constraints
