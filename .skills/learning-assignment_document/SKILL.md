# Learning Assignment Document

## Objectives

Guide students in creating well-structured assignment submission documents that meet academic requirements.

## Instructions

### 1. Document Structure

**Standard assignment document structure:**

```
Assignment Title
Student Information
├── Name
├── Student ID
├── Section/Class
└── Date

Step-by-Step Content
├── Step X: Title
│   ├── Screenshots (with captions)
│   ├── Code snippets (if needed)
│   ├── Output/Results
│   └── Discussion/Analysis
└── Repeat for each step

Conclusion/Summary (if required)
References (if required)
```

### 2. Required Sections

**Title Page:**

- Course code and name
- Assignment/Lab number and title
- Student name
- Student ID (if required)
- Section/Class number
- Submission date

**For Each Step:**

- Step number and title (matching assignment requirements)
- Clear screenshots showing:
  - Code execution
  - Output/results
  - Plots/visualizations
  - Error messages (if debugging)
- Brief explanation of what the screenshot shows
- Discussion/analysis (if required by step)

**Discussion Sections:**

- Answer specific questions from assignment
- Analyze results and patterns
- Compare different approaches
- Explain observations and conclusions

### 3. Screenshot Guidelines

**What to capture:**

- Full terminal/console output showing command and results
- Complete plots with titles, labels, and legends
- Code editor showing relevant code sections
- Error messages with context

**Screenshot quality:**

- Clear and readable text (not blurry)
- Appropriate zoom level (not too small)
- Include relevant context (window title, file name)
- Crop unnecessary parts (desktop background, etc.)

**Captions:**

- Number screenshots: "Figure 1: ...", "Figure 2: ..."
- Descriptive caption: "Figure 1: Zipf's Law distribution for literary text"
- Reference in text: "As shown in Figure 1, ..."

### 4. Code Snippets

**When to include:**

- Key functions or algorithms
- Modified/custom code
- Code that answers specific questions
- Error fixes or debugging steps

**Format:**

- Use monospace font (Courier New, Consolas)
- Include syntax highlighting if possible
- Add line numbers for reference
- Keep snippets focused (10-30 lines)

**Example:**

```
Code Snippet 1: Calculate Zipf metrics

def calculate_zipf_metrics(df):
    log_rank = np.log(df['rank'])
    log_freq = np.log(df['frequency'])
    slope, _, r_value, _, _ = stats.linregress(log_rank, log_freq)
    return -slope, r_value**2
```

### 5. Discussion/Analysis Format

**Structure:**

- Start with observation: "The results show that..."
- Provide evidence: "As seen in Figure X, ..."
- Explain why: "This occurs because..."
- Draw conclusions: "Therefore, we can conclude..."

**Example for comparative analysis:**

```
Step 5: Comparative Analysis

The two texts show different Zipf distributions:

1. Shape of Zipf Curve:
   - Literary text (Emma): Smoother curve with R² = 0.95
   - Informational text (Bible): Slightly steeper with R² = 0.93
   - Both follow Zipf's Law closely (linear on log-log scale)

2. Frequency Decay:
   - Literary: α = 1.08 (moderate decay)
   - Informational: α = 1.15 (faster decay)
   - Higher α indicates more concentrated vocabulary

3. Vocabulary Richness:
   - Literary: 7,500 unique words
   - Informational: 12,000 unique words
   - Bible has richer vocabulary due to diverse content

Conclusion: Both texts confirm Zipf's Law, but informational
text shows steeper decay and larger vocabulary.
```

### 6. Common Patterns

### 6. Common Patterns

**ML Course Labs (CST8506):**

Two approaches:
1. **From Scratch** - Create new template with full structure
2. **From DOCX** - Preserve instructor's format, only add images

**For detailed ML lab patterns:** See `references/ml-lab-patterns.md`

**Key workflow:**
- Generate Python script → Run script → Generate screenshots → Create/update markdown → Write actual descriptions → Convert to .docx

**Critical for DOCX templates:**
- DO NOT change title, numbering, or structure
- ONLY add image references and descriptions

**Writing descriptions:**
- Write actual explanations directly, NO placeholders or prompts
- Analyze the code and output to provide real content
- Use natural language as if a student wrote it
- Be specific about what the code does and what results show
- Example: "This code loads the diabetes dataset using pandas read_csv() function and stores it in a DataFrame." NOT "[Describe what this code does]" or "Description: (explain the code)"

**NLP/DL Course Labs:**
Structure may vary - check course-specific templates

**General Lab with Multiple Steps:**
- Each step: Screenshot + Code + Discussion
- Follow assignment requirements exactly

Structure: May vary by course - check course-specific templates

**Pattern 3: General Lab with Multiple Steps**

```
Lab 1: Title
Student Info

Step 1: Setup
- Screenshot: Environment setup
- Discussion: Installation process

Step 2: Data Loading
- Screenshot: Data loaded successfully
- Code: Loading function
- Discussion: Data characteristics

Step 3: Analysis
- Screenshot: Analysis output
- Screenshot: Visualization
- Discussion: Results interpretation

...
```

**Pattern 4: Programming Assignment**

```
Assignment 1: Title
Student Info

Part 1: Implementation
- Code snippets with explanations
- Screenshots of test runs

Part 2: Testing
- Test cases and results
- Screenshots of all tests passing

Part 3: Analysis
- Performance analysis
- Discussion of approach
```

**Pattern 5: Research/Analysis Assignment**

```
Assignment: Title
Student Info

Introduction
- Problem statement
- Approach overview

Methodology
- Steps taken
- Tools used

Results
- Screenshots of outputs
- Tables/charts
- Observations

Discussion
- Analysis of results
- Comparison with expectations
- Limitations

Conclusion
```

### 7. Formatting Tips

**Fonts:**

- Body text: 11-12pt, Arial or Calibri
- Headings: 14-16pt, bold
- Code: 10pt, Courier New or Consolas

**Spacing:**

- Line spacing: 1.15 or 1.5
- Space before/after headings
- Margins: 1 inch (2.54 cm) all sides

**Organization:**

- Use numbered headings (1, 1.1, 1.2, 2, 2.1, ...)
- Consistent formatting throughout
- Page numbers in footer
- Table of contents for long documents (optional)
